		<h1>We Hate Kate</h1>
		<h2>Absoulte Imbecile</h2>
	
		<p>We hate Kate because she is the worst. She thinks she is better than everyone else. LIAR LIAR LIAR. Also she is a white women and obviously we hate those too. Imagine being a woman. All she does is whine and lie. Don't even get me started on how she is constantly hungry, except for when you sit down to eat. She can never decide what to order and always ends up WHINING on how she ordered the wrong thing. What a ho. Morale of the story. She sucks (rarely).</p>
